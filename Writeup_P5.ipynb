    "**Vehicle Detection Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals / steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier\n",
    "* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. \n",
    "* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.\n",
    "* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.\n",
    "* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.\n",
    "* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.\n",

    "### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this step is in \"Feature Extraction\" section of the IPython notebook provided (named 'P5_Vehcle_detection.ipynb'). The 'extract_features' function uses 3 different functions namely 'bin_spatial', 'color_hist' and 'get_hog_features' to get spatial, color and hog features respectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images. There were a total of 8792 cars and 8968 non_cars image provided. Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image1]\n",
    "\n",
    "I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`). Varying these parameters, we get different feature vectors. To have a visualization of the hog feature, I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example using the `YCrCb` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=8`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "The length of the feature vector used is 1980 in my case.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "I played with different parameters such as `color_space`, `orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, `cell_per_block`, `hog_channel`, `spatial_size` and `hist_bins`. Tried using different combination of these parameters, trained the SVM classifier using two different Kernel namely 'linear' and 'rbf', tested on validation set (got from 20% of total images of cars and non_cars). These different combination gave us different value of Accuracy of classifying cars and non_cars differently, then choosed the best among them that comes out to be following:\n",
    "\n",
    "***** TODO *********** SHow TABle of final parameters *******\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).\n",
    "In \"Training a Classifier\" section of the P5_Vehicle_detection.ipynb file, code for classfier is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "First I trained the SVM using linear kernel. Tried with different parameters that gave me around 98.5-99 % accuracy. Proceeded with this, tested on test_images. Then thought to use 'rbf' kernel instead of 'linear' one. Got an amazing accuracy of 99.48 %.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sliding Window Search\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?\n",
    "\n",
    "In \"Sliding Window\" section of the file, I implemented the sliding window search. Gone through few test_images to see what is the pixel range (width and height) of the car to be detected. Tried few square window with varied length, lastly finalized with (96,96), (128,128) and (64,64) windows. Also, to avoid searching for Car in the sky portion of image, y_start_stop and x_start_stop were used, which searchs mainly in and around bottom right quarter of the image.   \n",
    "It was mainly hit and trial to decide with scales to search and how much portion to overlap with last window. Tried with higher overlap for bigger window, to uniformalize the heat map threshold (discussed in upcoming section). \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately I searched on two scales using YCrCb 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which provided a nice result.  Here are some example images:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Video Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)\n",
    "Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes then overlaid on the last frame of video:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here are six frames and their corresponding heatmaps:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Here is the output of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` on the integrated heatmap from all six frames:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Here the resulting bounding boxes are drawn onto the last frame in the series:\n",

    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.  \n",
